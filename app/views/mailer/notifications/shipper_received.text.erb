Hello <%= @user.name %>,

Your shipper for package <%= @package.description %> has received your package!

Once you pay the required fees, the shipper will send the package to you.
You can do this here: <%= package_url @package %>

If the shipper does not respond 1-2 business days after payment, please email <%= Mailer::EMAIL %> with the package ID (#<%= @package.id %>).

Regards,
The OhShip Team
