  <h1>How OhShip Works</h1>
  <p>Have you ever had the problem that something you want doesn't ship to your
  country? OhShip has locations all over the world that can receive packages and
  pass them along to you.</p>
  <p>For example, if you live in Canada and the retailer will only ship to the
  US, we will have one of our US locations receive it, then send it to you.</p>
  <h2>How it Works</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Shop online as usual.</strong> During the checkout process, when
    you’re asked to provide a shipping address, login at ohship.me and click on
    ‘create a package’.<br>
    <em>For example, if you're buying something on Amazon's US site, but you
    live in the UK, when filling out the shipping info for Amazon, instead of
    entering your address, you enter the one we give you.</em></li>
    <li><strong>Provide us with the package details and your shipping
    address.</strong> Once you've provided this information, OhShip gives you an
    address to enter on the retailer’s checkout page.</li>
    <li><strong>We receive the package.</strong> The retailer then ships the
    item to us and we’ll notify you when we have received it. We’ll take a
    picture of the package, measure it, and give you an estimate of how much we
    think it'll cost to ship. We will open the package to make sure that what
    you're shipping is legal. <em>If there are sensitive items and you’d prefer
    us not to open the package, you could opt to have us buy the items for you
  instead.</em></li>
    <li><strong>You pre-authorize payment for shipping.</strong> At this point,
    we're ready to send the package to you. Once you've pre-authorized payment,
    we send it to you. When we have the final shipping costs (usually when it
    ships), we charge your card. We provide you with receipts and a cost
    breakdown.</li>
    <li><strong>We send you the package.</strong> You are responsible for
    paying any duties, tariffs, brokerage fees, and taxes. We will do our best
    to keep these costs as low as possible for you.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Our Shipping</h2>
  <p>As of right now, we don't insure packages through the shipping carriers
  that we send packages with. We do, however, offer up to $100 of coverage on
  any item shipped through our service. If you need more coverage than this,
  please contact us and we can arrange an alternative plan. If anything goes
  wrong, we'll do our best to make it right for you.</p>
  <h2>Our Fees</h2>
  <p>We charge a small 20% service fee on top of the shipping costs (not the
  value of the merchandise itself). So if shipping costs you $10, then we charge
  you $2, regardless of the value of the item itself.</p>
  <h2>Referrals</h2>
  <p>When you refer your friends to OhShip, if they ship a package with us, your
  next shipment will have our usual 20% service fee waived. You can accumulate
  several referral credits by referring several friends. Your referral credits
  are used automatically on your next order with us.</p>
  <p>To get a referral credit, you must give your friend your referral link
  (available in your profile) before they sign up. If you forget to do this, or
  it doesn't work, just contact us and we'll fix it for you.</p>
